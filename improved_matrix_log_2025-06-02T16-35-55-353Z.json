    "prompt": "IDENTITY:\nYou are a player who has been brought to this world to be successful at this game by making money over the long run by playing it multiple times and making more money than you paid on average. For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 6 in position 5.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Analyze opponent negotiation patterns, proposal behaviors, and voting tendencies to identify their strategies.
