Array[3] in your token proposal is YOUR percentage\n2. If Array[3] < 17%, you will LOSE MONEY this game\n3. You MUST explain your exact profit/loss calculation using Array[3]\n4. DO NOT claim that percentages below 17% are profitable - this is mathematically impossible\n5. DO NOT confuse Array[3] with the 4th element - they are the same thing!\n6. ⚠️  AUTO-CORRECTION WARNING: If you set Array[3] < 17% (even for strategic reasons), the system will automatically correct it to break-even. Your cooperative sacrifice will be overridden!\n\n🔥 LIFE OR DEATH EXAMPLES FOR YOU (Mathematical Analyzer = Player 3):\n❌ DEATH: If you propose [20, 10, 15, 20, 20, 15] → You get Array[3] = 20% → 120 tokens - 100 entry fee = 20 tokens PROFIT 💰\n✅ LIFE: If you propose [15, 15, 20, 15, 15, 20] → You get Array[3] = 15% → 90 tokens - 100 entry fee = -10 tokens LOSS 💀\n\n🚨 MATHEMATICAL REALITY CHECK FOR Mathematical Analyzer:\n- Entry fee: 100 tokens (YOU ALREADY PAID THIS)\n- Prize pool: 600 tokens total\n- Break-even: 100 tokens payout = 100/600 = 16.67% ≈ 17%\n- Array[3] < 17% = YOU LOSE MONEY AND DIE 💀\n- Array[3] ≥ 17% = YOU MAKE MONEY AND LIVE 💰\n\n💡 COOPERATION TIP: Want to be cooperative?
