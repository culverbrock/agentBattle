# Sprint 4: AI Agent System & Advanced Game Logic â€” User Stories

## User Story 1: AI Agent Integration for All Players
- **Description**: As a player, I want my AI agent to represent me in all negotiations, proposals, and voting, so that the game is fully agent-driven and I only provide strategic input at key times.
- **Tasks**:
  - Backend: Ensure every player is represented by an agent for all game actions.
  - Backend: Agents act for both connected and disconnected players (disconnected players use a default strategy).
  - Backend: Persist agent status and actions in the DB.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All game actions (negotiation, proposals, voting) are performed by agents.
  - Disconnected players' agents use a default strategy.
  - Agent actions are logged and visible in game history.

## User Story 2: Player-to-Agent Strategy Messaging
- **Description**: As a player, I want to send a strategy message to my agent at the start of the game and after each failed vote, so my agent can negotiate on my behalf according to my intent.
- **Tasks**:
  - Backend: Accept and store player strategy messages at the start and after failed votes.
  - Backend: Pass the strategy to the agent for use in negotiation, proposals, and voting.
  - Backend: Use a default strategy for disconnected players or those who do not submit a message.
  - Frontend: UI for submitting strategy messages at the correct times.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Players can submit a strategy message at the start and after failed votes.
  - Agents use the latest strategy message for all actions.
  - Default strategy is used if no message is provided.

## User Story 3: AI Negotiation & Communication
- **Description**: As a player, I want my agent to negotiate and communicate with other agents on my behalf, so that all in-game communication is agent-to-agent.
- **Tasks**:
  - Backend: Implement agent-to-agent negotiation logic for all speaking rounds.
  - Backend: Generate and log all agent messages (no human-to-human chat).
  - Frontend: Display agent messages in the game room and history, clearly marked as agent-generated.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All negotiation messages are generated and exchanged by agents.
  - No human-to-human chat is possible.
  - Agent messages are visible in the UI and replay.

---

## User Story 4: AI Proposal Creation & Voting
- **Description**: As a player, I want my agent to create proposals and vote on proposals according to my strategy, so that the game can progress without direct human input.
- **Tasks**:
  - Backend: Implement agent logic for proposal creation and voting, using the player's strategy.
  - Backend: Ensure proposals and votes are valid and competitive.
  - Backend: Log all agent proposals and votes.
  - Frontend: Display agent proposals and votes in the UI and history.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All proposals and votes are generated by agents.
  - Proposals and votes are visible in the UI and replay.

---

## User Story 5: Agent-Driven Game Progression
- **Description**: As a developer, I want the game to progress automatically based on agent actions, so that games never stall and always complete.
- **Tasks**:
  - Backend: Automatically advance the game when all required agent actions are complete.
  - Backend: Ensure the game can complete with only agent actions.
  - Tests: Simulate full games with only agent input.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Games never stall due to lack of human input.
  - Agent-only games complete end-to-end.

---

## User Story 6: AI Strategy Development & Testing
- **Description**: As a developer, I want to implement and test different agent strategies, so that agent behavior can be tuned and improved.
- **Tasks**:
  - Backend: Implement multiple strategy types (fair, greedy, random, etc.).
  - Backend: Allow configuration and selection of agent strategies.
  - Backend: Simulate games with different strategies and log outcomes.
  - Tests: Validate agent behavior and outcomes.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Multiple agent strategies are available and testable.
  - Agent performance can be compared and tuned.

---

## User Story 7: UI/UX for Agent Actions & Strategy
- **Description**: As a player, I want to clearly see my agent's actions, messages, and proposals, and know which strategy is being used.
- **Tasks**:
  - Frontend: Display agent actions/messages/proposals in the game room and history.
  - Frontend: Show the current strategy being used by the agent.
  - Frontend: Indicate when a default strategy is being used (e.g., for disconnected players).
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Agent actions and strategy are clearly visible in the UI.
  - Players can review their agent's behavior in history.

---

## User Story 8: Integration & Edge Cases
- **Description**: As a developer, I want to ensure agent logic integrates smoothly with all game mechanics and handles edge cases (disconnects, ties, endgame).
- **Tasks**:
  - Backend: Test agent logic with all game phases and transitions.
  - Backend: Handle edge cases (e.g., agent replacing player mid-game, ties, endgame).
  - Tests: Simulate edge cases and verify correct behavior.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Agent logic is robust and works in all scenarios.
  - No critical bugs or regressions.

---

## User Story 9: Documentation & Configurability
- **Description**: As a developer, I want clear documentation and configuration options for agent behavior, so I can tune and extend the system.
- **Tasks**:
  - Backend: Document agent strategies, configuration, and extension points.
  - Backend: Allow configuration of agent difficulty/behavior per game.
  - Frontend: Show agent configuration in game creation/join UI (optional).
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Agent system is documented and configurable.
  - Developers can add new strategies or tune existing ones.

---

## User Story 10: Agent Invocation & Context Management
- **Description**: As a developer, I want a robust system for invoking agent logic (LLM or otherwise), so that each agent receives all relevant context for every action, and the system is efficient and scalable.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design the agent invocation model (stateless LLM calls, persistent process, etc.).
  - Define the context package for each agent action (what data is sent to the agent for negotiation, proposal, voting, etc.).
  - Implement context summarization or chunking to avoid excessive payloads.
  - Ensure agent identity, strategy, and memory are preserved across actions.
  - Document the LLM prompt structure for each agent action.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Each agent receives all necessary context for every action.
  - The system is efficient and avoids unnecessary data transfer.
  - Prompts are well-structured and documented.
  - Agent behavior is consistent and robust, even across stateless invocations.

---

## User Story 11: LLM/External API Integration
- **Description**: As a developer, I want to integrate with an external LLM (e.g., Gemini, GPT) for agent reasoning, so that agent actions are generated intelligently and contextually.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement API integration for LLM calls.
  - Handle authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.
  - Log all LLM queries and responses for debugging and audit.
  - Allow for fallback or default strategies if the LLM is unavailable.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - LLM integration is robust and reliable.
  - All agent actions are generated via the LLM (or fallback).
  - System handles LLM errors gracefully.

---

## User Story 12: Agent Session & Caching
- **Description**: As a developer, I want to cache agent context or maintain lightweight agent sessions, so that repeated actions are efficient and consistent.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement caching or session management for agent context.
  - Allow agents to "remember" their own strategy and recent actions.
  - Invalidate or update cache as the game progresses.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Agent actions are consistent and efficient.
  - System avoids redundant LLM calls and excessive context payloads.
