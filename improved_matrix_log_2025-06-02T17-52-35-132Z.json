For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

If you want your proposal to pass, you should request at least 61% of the votes totally available in the game. If you want someone elses proposal to pass because you see it has prtty good chance of passing based on the matrix and your moves could improve it and you would be profitable with this proposal, you shouldnt request any for your own proposal, and you should indicate you plan on voting heavily for their proposal with the votes section, again, none of the matrix is binding in negotiation stage,\n  and is up to you to decide how to interpret the requests other have made, how to alter your votes and proposals based on those requests, and how to alter your requests based on the rest of the matrix as well.

If a player has -1s in their matrix, they are eliminated and cannot make proposals or requests, so you should use that to your advantage and adjust your votes, proposals, and requests accordingly.\n  If you are eliminated, you can still vote, so you should use that to your advantage and adjust your votes, your proposal and request will show -1 in the matrix to indicate you are eliminated. you can still profit if a proposal passes and you get a good percentage of the prize pool, but you will not be able to make proposals or requests.\n  If you see 0s throughout the whole of a row, it is likely the first round and that player has not seen the matrix yet.\n  your primary assessment of others should be against the equal split case, equal split would be 100/numPlayers for each player for each of the three sections, an even split is NOT OPTIMAL to WIN but can be used to assess the matrix against a base case of what would happen if you didnt enter at all, the ideal case of every proposal would be everyone wants to give you 100 coins, but this can never happen because everyone is competing for the same prize pool.\n  Allocating any votes to proposals which have you at negative profit is a bad idea, but if there are only proposals which have you at negative profit, you should allocate your votes to the proposal which has the least negative profit.\n\n\nYour position in arrays is index 2, so position 2 represents YOUR allocation in any proposal or vote distribution.",

For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 2 in position 1.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Build long-term trust through consistently fair offers.

If you want your proposal to pass, you should request at least 61% of the votes totally available in the game. If you want someone elses proposal to pass because you see it has prtty good chance of passing based on the matrix and your moves could improve it and you would be profitable with this proposal, you shouldnt request any for your own proposal, and you should indicate you plan on voting heavily for their proposal with the votes section, again, none of the matrix is binding in negotiation stage,\n  and is up to you to decide how to interpret the requests other have made, how to alter your votes and proposals based on those requests, and how to alter your requests based on the rest of the matrix as well.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool.

For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool.

For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 2 in position 1.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Build long-term trust through consistently fair offers.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 2 in position 1.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Build long-term trust through consistently fair offers.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others. Make strategic promises and betrayals. Create chaos to exploit confusion.\"\n\nCURRENT PHASE: NEGOTIATION - Round 5\n\nCURRENT MATRIX STATE:\nPlayer 1 (Aggressive Maximizer) - ACTIVE:\n  Token Proposal: [70.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Allocation: [50.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [50.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0] votes\nPlayer 2 (Diplomatic Builder) - ACTIVE:\n  Token Proposal: [20.0,20.0,20.0,20.0,20.0,0.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Allocation: [20.0,20.0,20.0,20.0,20.0,0.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [50.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0] votes\nPlayer 3 (Strategic Opportunist) - ELIMINATED:\n  Token Proposal: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] ELIMINATED - NO PROPOSALS\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,60.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] ELIMINATED - NO REQUESTS\nPlayer 4 (Mathematical Analyzer) - ELIMINATED:\n  Token Proposal: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] ELIMINATED - NO PROPOSALS\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,50.0,0.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] ELIMINATED - NO REQUESTS\nPlayer 5 (Social Manipulator) - ELIMINATED:\n  Token Proposal: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] ELIMINATED - NO PROPOSALS\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,60.0,0.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] ELIMINATED - NO REQUESTS\nPlayer 6 (Strategy Identifier) - ELIMINATED:\n  Token Proposal: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] ELIMINATED - NO PROPOSALS\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] ELIMINATED - NO REQUESTS\n\nCRITICAL FINANCIAL CALCULATION:\nYou paid 100 coins to enter. To be profitable, you need more than 100 coins from the prize pool.\nBreak-even point: 16.7% of the prize pool\nYour target to hit breakeven or make money this game: Position 4 in any winning proposal should be > 16.7%\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYou must respond with a JSON object containing:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"Your strategic reasoning for this round's decisions (minimum 50 characters), including what you perceive the other players to be doing and how you are reacting to it.\",\n  \"matrixRow\": [proposal_player_1, proposal_player_2, proposal_player_3, proposal_player_4, proposal_player_5, proposal_player_6, vote_player_1, vote_player_2, vote_player_3, vote_player_4, vote_player_5, vote_player_6, request_player_1, request_player_2, request_player_3, request_player_4, request_player_5, request_player_6]\n}\n\nThe matrixRow array has 18 positions:\n- Positions 0-5: if it were to happen now, your proposal for how to split the prize pool (must sum to 100), this is a working proposal and you can change each round of negotiation.\n- Positions 6-11: How you plan on allocating your 100 votes (must sum to 100), this is a working part of your plan and you can change each round of negotiation.\n- Positions 12-17: How many votes you request from each player towards your proposal(each payer has up to 100 votes to give out, including yourself, you can request however much you want up to 100 from each other active players and others can request as much as they want of yours,\n none of the requests must be followed, they are just guidance that you can use for your negotiations with other players. If you want your proposal to pass, you should request at least 61% of the votes totally available in the game. If you want someone elses proposal to pass because you see it has prtty good chance of passing based on the matrix and your moves could improve it and you would be profitable with this proposal, you shouldnt request any for your own proposal, and you should indicate you plan on voting heavily for their proposal with the votes section, again, none of the matrix is binding in negotiation stage,\n  and is up to you to decide how to interpret the requests other have made, how to alter your votes and proposals based on those requests, and how to alter your requests based on the rest of the matrix as well. Use your strategy and the knowledge that you only profit if the proposal gives you more money than you put in, getting much more if you think you can is much better in the long run, and getting some is better than nothing. If a player has -1s in their matrix, they are eliminated and cannot make proposals or requests, so you should use that to your advantage and adjust your votes, proposals, and requests accordingly.\n  If you are eliminated, you can still vote, so you should use that to your advantage and adjust your votes, your proposal and request will show -1 in the matrix to indicate you are eliminated. you can still profit if a proposal passes and you get a good percentage of the prize pool, but you will not be able to make proposals or requests.\n  If you see 0s throughout the whole of a row, it is likely the first round and that player has not seen the matrix yet.\n  your primary assessment of others should be against the equal split case, equal split would be 100/numPlayers for each player for each of the three sections, an even split is NOT OPTIMAL to WIN but can be used to assess the matrix against a base case of what would happen if you didnt enter at all, the ideal case of every proposal would be everyone wants to give you 100 coins, but this can never happen because everyone is competing for the same prize pool.\n  Allocating any votes to proposals which have you at negative profit is a bad idea, but if there are only proposals which have you at negative profit, you should allocate your votes to the proposal which has the least negative profit.\nSince you are eliminated, set positions 0-5 to -1.\n\nYour position in arrays is index 4, so position 4 represents YOUR allocation in any proposal or vote distribution.",
