## Core Starting Strategies

The simulation began with 5 distinct strategic archetypes, each starting with 500 coins:

| Strategy | Archetype | Core Approach |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Aggressive Maximizer** | AGGRESSIVE | Demand the largest possible share. Use threats and aggressive tactics. Form coalitions only when absolutely necessary to avoid elimination. |
| **Diplomatic Builder** | DIPLOMATIC | Build long-term trust through consistently fair offers. Prioritize mutual benefit and stable coalitions. Avoid betrayals. |
| **Strategic Opportunist** | OPPORTUNISTIC | Adapt rapidly to changing situations. Form and break alliances based on immediate advantage. Keep all options open. |
| **Mathematical Analyzer** | ANALYTICAL | Make all decisions based on expected value calculations. Minimize risk through probability analysis. Avoid emotional decisions. |
| **Social Manipulator** | MANIPULATIVE | Use psychological tactics to influence others. Make strategic promises and betrayals. Create chaos to exploit confusion. |

**Economic Rules:**
- Starting balance: 500 coins
- Entry fee per game: 100 coins
- Bankruptcy threshold: <100 coins (eliminated and replaced)
- Prize distribution based on winning proposals
