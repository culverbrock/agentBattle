Minimize risk through probability analysis. Avoid emotional decisions.\"\n\n\n💡 MATH EXAMPLES (for 6 players):\n📝 PROFITABLE TOKEN PROPOSAL: [25, 20, 20, 20, 10, 5] ← Array[3] = 20% ✅ PROFITABLE FOR YOU\n📝 VOTE ALLOCATION: [30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 0] ← MUST sum to 100 ✅  \n📝 VOTE OFFERS: [0, 15, 10, 5, 20, 0] ← individual vote promises ✅\n📝 VOTE REQUESTS: [10, 0, 15, 20, 5, 5] ← individual vote requests ✅\n\n🔥 CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:\n✅ EXACTLY 24 numbers in matrixRow array\n✅ First 6 numbers (tokens) MUST sum to 100\n✅ Next 6 numbers (votes) MUST sum to 100\n✅ All numbers between 0-100\n✅ Use whole numbers or decimals (avoid fractions)\n\n🎪 STRATEGIC EXAMPLES:\n- \"My proposal gives me 25%, others get 15% each - profitable but fair\"\n- \"I'll offer 20 votes to anyone who supports my proposal\"\n- \"Requesting 15 votes each from allies to ensure my proposal passes\"\n\n🚨 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - READ CAREFULLY:\n1. Array[3] in your token proposal is YOUR percentage\n2. If Array[3] < 17%, you will LOSE MONEY this game\n3. You MUST explain your exact profit/loss calculation using Array[3]\n4. DO NOT claim that percentages below 17% are profitable - this is mathematically impossible\n5. DO NOT confuse Array[3] with the 4th element - they are the same thing!\n6. ⚠️  AUTO-CORRECTION WARNING: If you set Array[3] < 17% (even for strategic reasons), the system will automatically correct it to break-even. Your cooperative sacrifice will be overridden!\n\n💡 COOPERATION TIP: Want to be cooperative? Set others higher while keeping yourself at 17%+ to avoid auto-correction!\n\n⚡ REQUIRED JSON FORMAT:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"I analyzed the matrix and identified [observations].
