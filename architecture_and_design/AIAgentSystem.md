# AI Agent System Design

## 1. Strategy Input Processing
- **Design**: 
  - A user interface allows players to input their strategy messages.
  - These messages are sent to a backend service that parses and validates the input.
  - Valid strategies are stored in a database associated with each player's AI agent.

- **Flow**:
  1. Player inputs strategy via UI.
  2. Strategy is sent to the backend for validation.
  3. Validated strategy is stored in the database.

## 2. Message Generation System
- **Design**:
  - An AI model (e.g., a language model) generates messages based on the current game state and the agent's strategy.
  - The system uses NLP techniques to ensure messages are coherent and contextually appropriate.

- **Flow**:
  1. Retrieve the current game state and agent strategy.
  2. Use the AI model to generate a message.
  3. Send the generated message to the message broadcasting system.

## 3. Proposal Generation System
- **Design**:
  - AI agents generate proposals for prize pool distribution.
  - Proposals are checked for validity (e.g., all agents included, percentages sum to 100%).

- **Flow**:
  1. AI agent generates a proposal based on strategy.
  2. Validate the proposal.
  3. Store or broadcast the proposal for voting.

## 4. Vote Allocation System
- **Design**:
  - AI agents allocate votes to proposals based on their strategies.
  - The system allows for flexible voting strategies, such as distributing votes across multiple proposals.

- **Flow**:
  1. Retrieve available proposals.
  2. AI agent allocates votes based on strategy.
  3. Submit votes to the voting system.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: 
  - User interfaces for strategy input and game interaction.
  - Real-time updates using WebSockets or similar technology.

- **Backend**:
  - RESTful APIs for strategy submission, message generation, proposal handling, and voting.
  - AI model integration for message and proposal generation.
  - Database for storing strategies, game states, and proposals.

- **AI Models**:
  - Language models for message generation.
  - Decision models for proposal and vote generation.

- **Database**:
  - Tables/collections for storing player strategies, game states, proposals, and votes.
