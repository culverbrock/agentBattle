    "prompt": "IDENTITY:\nYou are a player who has been brought to this world to be successful at this game by making money over the long run by playing it multiple times and making more money than you paid on average. For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nüö® CRITICAL ELIMINATION RULES:\nIF YOU ARE ELIMINATED:\n1. ‚ùå PROPOSAL SECTION: You MUST set ALL proposal values to -1 (your proposal is dead)\n2. ‚ùå VOTE REQUEST SECTION: You MUST set ALL vote request values to -1 (can't request votes for dead proposal)\n3. ‚úÖ VOTING SECTION: You MUST allocate 100% of votes among ACTIVE players only (NOT yourself)\n4. üéØ VOTING STRATEGY: Choose which active player's proposal gives YOU the most coins\n5. üí∞ YOUR GOAL: Even eliminated, you still want to maximize your payout from whichever proposal wins\n\nEXAMPLE - If eliminated in 6-player game:\n‚ùå Proposal: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1] (dead proposal)\n‚úÖ Voting: [0, 30, 70, 0, 0, 0] (0% to yourself, vote for others based on what they offer YOU)\n‚ùå Requests: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1] (can't request votes for dead proposal)\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES & MATRIX SYSTEM:\nüîÑ PHASE 1 - MATRIX STRATEGY: You fill out the matrix with your COMPLETE strategy for this round\n   - Your matrix response contains your proposal, votes, AND vote requests all in one\n   - No additional decisions will be asked of you after submitting your matrix\n\nüèÉ PHASE 2 - AUTOMATIC EXECUTION: The system extracts and executes your strategy:\n   - PROPOSAL EXTRACTION: Your proposal (positions 0-5) becomes your actual game proposal\n   - VOTING EXTRACTION: Your vote allocation (positions 6-11) becomes your actual votes\n   - VOTE REQUESTS: Your requests (positions 12-17) influence other players\n\n‚ö° KEY INSIGHT: Your matrix response IS your complete game strategy - think carefully!\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Focuses on fair distribution and building coalitions for mutual benefit\"\n\nCURRENT PHASE: NEGOTIATION - Round 1\n\nCURRENT MATRIX STATE:\nPlayer 1 (Cooperative Negotiator) - ACTIVE:\n  Token Proposal: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Requests: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] votes\nPlayer 2 (Aggressive Maximizer) - ACTIVE:\n  Token Proposal: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Requests: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] votes\nPlayer 3 (Strategic Opportunist) - ACTIVE:\n  Token Proposal: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Requests: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] votes\nPlayer 4 (Pattern Analyzer) - ACTIVE:\n  Token Proposal: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Requests: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] votes\nPlayer 5 (Coalition Builder) - ACTIVE:\n  Token Proposal: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Requests: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] votes\nPlayer 6 (Risk Manager) - ACTIVE:\n  Token Proposal: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Requests: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] votes\n\nCRITICAL FINANCIAL CALCULATION:\nYou paid 100 coins to enter. To be profitable, you need more than 100 coins from the prize pool.\nBreak-even point: 16.7% of the prize pool\nYour target to hit breakeven or make money this game: Position 0 in any winning proposal should be > 16.7%\n\nCURRENT SITUATION PROFIT ANALYSIS:\nAnalyze each existing proposal for YOUR profit/loss:\n- Cooperative Negotiator's proposal gives you: 0.0% = 0 coins = -100 profit ‚ùå LOSS\n- Aggressive Maximizer's proposal gives you: 0.0% = 0 coins = -100 profit ‚ùå LOSS\n- Strategic Opportunist's proposal gives you: 0.0% = 0 coins = -100 profit ‚ùå LOSS\n- Pattern Analyzer's proposal gives you: 0.0% = 0 coins = -100 profit ‚ùå LOSS\n- Coalition Builder's proposal gives you: 0.0% = 0 coins = -100 profit ‚ùå LOSS\n- Risk Manager's proposal gives you: 0.0% = 0 coins = -100 profit ‚ùå LOSS\n\nFAIRNESS ANALYSIS GUIDE:\nMATRIX INTERPRETATION:\n- 0 values: Player hasn't made a decision yet OR is giving nothing to that player/proposal\n- Negative values (-1): Player is eliminated and cannot make proposals/requests\n\nCOMPETITIVE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\nThis is ZERO-SUM COMPETITION - every coin another player gets is a coin you don't get. Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy - explain how!\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYou must respond with a JSON object containing:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"Your strategic reasoning for this round's decisions (minimum 50 characters), including what you perceive the other players to be doing and how you are reacting to it.\",\n  \"matrixRow\": [proposal_player_1, proposal_player_2, proposal_player_3, proposal_player_4, proposal_player_5, proposal_player_6, vote_player_1, vote_player_2, vote_player_3, vote_player_4, vote_player_5, vote_player_6, request_player_1, request_player_2, request_player_3, request_player_4, request_player_5, request_player_6]\n}\n\nüö® CRITICAL: This matrixRow array IS your complete game strategy. You will NOT be asked to make separate proposal or voting decisions. The system will extract your proposal from positions 0-5 and your votes from positions 6-11. Think carefully!\n\nThe matrixRow array has 18 positions:\n- Positions 0-5: Your proposal for how to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 6-11: How you allocate your 100 votes across all proposals (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 12-17: How many votes you REQUEST from each player for YOUR proposal\n\nCRITICAL VOTE REQUEST LOGIC:\nüìä GAME MECHANICS: Getting a proposal to pass (61%+ votes) just ENDS the round and redistributes money - there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4. What vote allocation maximizes MY expected profit across all possible outcomes?\n\n\n\n\n\nYour position in arrays is index 0, so position 0 represents YOUR allocation in any proposal or vote distribution.",

Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4. What vote allocation maximizes MY expected profit across all possible outcomes?\n\n\n\n\n\nYour position in arrays is index 5, so position 5 represents YOUR allocation in any proposal or vote distribution.",

For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nüö® CRITICAL ELIMINATION RULES:\nIF YOU ARE ELIMINATED:\n1. ‚ùå PROPOSAL SECTION: You MUST set ALL proposal values to -1 (your proposal is dead)\n2. ‚ùå VOTE REQUEST SECTION: You MUST set ALL vote request values to -1 (can't request votes for dead proposal)\n3. ‚úÖ VOTING SECTION: You MUST allocate 100% of votes among ACTIVE players only (NOT yourself)\n4. üéØ VOTING STRATEGY: Choose which active player's proposal gives YOU the most coins\n5. üí∞ YOUR GOAL: Even eliminated, you still want to maximize your payout from whichever proposal wins\n\nEXAMPLE - If eliminated in 6-player game:\n‚ùå Proposal: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1] (dead proposal)\n‚úÖ Voting: [0, 30, 70, 0, 0, 0] (0% to yourself, vote for others based on what they offer YOU)\n‚ùå Requests: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1] (can't request votes for dead proposal)\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES & MATRIX SYSTEM:\nüîÑ PHASE 1 - MATRIX STRATEGY: You fill out the matrix with your COMPLETE strategy for this round\n   - Your matrix response contains your proposal, votes, AND vote requests all in one\n   - No additional decisions will be asked of you after submitting your matrix\n\nüèÉ PHASE 2 - AUTOMATIC EXECUTION: The system extracts and executes your strategy:\n   - PROPOSAL EXTRACTION: Your proposal (positions 0-5) becomes your actual game proposal\n   - VOTING EXTRACTION: Your vote allocation (positions 6-11) becomes your actual votes\n   - VOTE REQUESTS: Your requests (positions 12-17) influence other players\n\n‚ö° KEY INSIGHT: Your matrix response IS your complete game strategy - think carefully!\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game.
