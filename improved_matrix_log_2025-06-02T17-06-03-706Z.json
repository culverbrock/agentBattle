For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool.
