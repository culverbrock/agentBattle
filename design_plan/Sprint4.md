# Sprint 4: AI and Game Logic

**Goal**: Integrate AI agents and finalize game logic.

#### Components

1. **GameCoreMechanics**
   - **What**: Implement round management, message broadcasting, and voting systems.
   - **Sub-components**:
     - **Round Management**: Controls the flow of the game, ensuring each round progresses correctly.
     - **Message Broadcasting**: Manages the distribution of messages between players and AI agents.
     - **Voting System**: Handles proposal voting, ensuring votes are counted and results are processed.
   - **Success Criteria**:
     - Rounds progress smoothly with correct transitions.
     - Messages are broadcasted accurately and timely.
     - Voting results are processed correctly and efficiently.
   - **Integration Points**:
     - Connects with `GameStateManagement` for round and state updates.
     - Interfaces with `BackendServices` for message and voting operations.

2. **AIAgentSystem**
   - **What**: Develop AI strategies, message generation, and proposal creation.
   - **Sub-components**:
     - **AI Strategy Development**: Create strategies for AI agents to use during gameplay.
     - **Message Generation**: Develop algorithms for AI agents to generate contextually relevant messages.
     - **Proposal Creation**: Implement logic for AI agents to create and evaluate proposals.
   - **Success Criteria**:
     - AI agents make strategic decisions that align with game objectives.
     - Messages generated by AI are coherent and contextually appropriate.
     - Proposals created by AI are valid and competitive.
   - **Integration Points**:
     - Utilizes `GameCoreMechanics` for round and voting logic.
     - Communicates with `BackendServices` for data retrieval and updates.

#### Deliverables
- Complete game mechanics, including round management, message broadcasting, and voting systems.
- Fully functional AI agent system with strategy development, message generation, and proposal creation.

#### Testing
- **AI Simulations**: Run simulations to test AI strategy effectiveness and decision-making processes.
- **Game Logic Testing**: Validate the correctness of round management, message broadcasting, and voting systems through unit and integration tests.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless interaction between AI agents and game mechanics, verifying data consistency and system stability.
