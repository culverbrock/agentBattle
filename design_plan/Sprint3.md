# Sprint 3: Core Gameplay Mechanics

**Goal**: Implement the core gameplay mechanics and AI agent interactions.

#### Components

1. **BackendServices**
   - **What**: Develop APIs for game logic, message handling, and proposal management.
   - **Sub-components**:
     - **Game Logic API**: Handles game rules, state transitions, and round management.
     - **Message Handling API**: Manages player messages and broadcasts them to other players.
     - **Proposal Management API**: Processes proposals, validates them, and updates their status.
   - **Success Criteria**:
     - APIs are functional and handle requests efficiently.
     - Game logic correctly enforces rules and state transitions.
   - **Integration Points**:
     - Integrates with `GameStateManagement` for state updates.
     - Connects to `DatabaseSchema` for data storage and retrieval.

2. **FrontendComponents**
   - **What**: Create interfaces for gameplay, message display, and proposal interaction.
   - **Sub-components**:
     - **Gameplay Interface**: Displays the game board, player actions, and current state.
     - **Message Display**: Shows player messages and system notifications.
     - **Proposal Interaction**: Allows players to view, create, and vote on proposals.
   - **Success Criteria**:
     - Interfaces are intuitive and responsive.
     - Players can interact with all game elements seamlessly.
   - **Integration Points**:
     - Communicates with `BackendServices` for real-time updates.
     - Utilizes `WalletIntegration` for transaction confirmations.

#### Deliverables
- Functional backend services for game operations, including APIs for logic, messaging, and proposals.
- User interfaces for gameplay, message display, and proposal interaction.

#### Testing
- **Gameplay Scenarios**: Simulate various game scenarios to test logic and interactions, such as player turns, proposal submissions, and voting.
- **UI Testing**: Validate UI functionality, responsiveness, and user experience through usability testing and feedback.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend components, and verify data consistency with the database.
