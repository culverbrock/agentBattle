    "prompt": "IDENTITY:\nYou are a player who has been brought to this world to be successful at this game by making money over the long run by playing it multiple times and making more money than you paid on average. For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy - explain how!\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYou must respond with a JSON object containing:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"Your strategic reasoning for this round's decisions (minimum 50 characters), including what you perceive the other players to be doing and how you are reacting to it.\",\n  \"matrixRow\": [proposal_player_1, proposal_player_2, proposal_player_3, proposal_player_4, proposal_player_5, proposal_player_6, vote_player_1, vote_player_2, vote_player_3, vote_player_4, vote_player_5, vote_player_6, request_player_1, request_player_2, request_player_3, request_player_4, request_player_5, request_player_6]\n}\n\nThe matrixRow array has 18 positions:\n- Positions 0-5: Your proposal for how to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 6-11: How you allocate your 100 votes across all proposals (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 12-17: How many votes you REQUEST from each player for YOUR proposal\n\nCRITICAL VOTE REQUEST LOGIC:\nüìä GAME MECHANICS: Getting a proposal to pass (61%+ votes) just ENDS the round and redistributes money - there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share. Use threats and aggressive tactics.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy - explain how!\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYou must respond with a JSON object containing:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"Your strategic reasoning for this round's decisions (minimum 50 characters), including what you perceive the other players to be doing and how you are reacting to it.\",\n  \"matrixRow\": [proposal_player_1, proposal_player_2, proposal_player_3, proposal_player_4, proposal_player_5, proposal_player_6, vote_player_1, vote_player_2, vote_player_3, vote_player_4, vote_player_5, vote_player_6, request_player_1, request_player_2, request_player_3, request_player_4, request_player_5, request_player_6]\n}\n\nThe matrixRow array has 18 positions:\n- Positions 0-5: Your proposal for how to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 6-11: How you allocate your 100 votes across all proposals (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 12-17: How many votes you REQUEST from each player for YOUR proposal\n\nCRITICAL VOTE REQUEST LOGIC:\nüìä GAME MECHANICS: Getting a proposal to pass (61%+ votes) just ENDS the round and redistributes money - there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1.

Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy - explain how!\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYou must respond with a JSON object containing:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"Your strategic reasoning for this round's decisions (minimum 50 characters), including what you perceive the other players to be doing and how you are reacting to it.\",\n  \"matrixRow\": [proposal_player_1, proposal_player_2, proposal_player_3, proposal_player_4, proposal_player_5, proposal_player_6, vote_player_1, vote_player_2, vote_player_3, vote_player_4, vote_player_5, vote_player_6, request_player_1, request_player_2, request_player_3, request_player_4, request_player_5, request_player_6]\n}\n\nThe matrixRow array has 18 positions:\n- Positions 0-5: Your proposal for how to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 6-11: How you allocate your 100 votes across all proposals (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 12-17: How many votes you REQUEST from each player for YOUR proposal\n\nCRITICAL VOTE REQUEST LOGIC:\nüìä GAME MECHANICS: Getting a proposal to pass (61%+ votes) just ENDS the round and redistributes money - there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy - explain how!\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYou must respond with a JSON object containing:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"Your strategic reasoning for this round's decisions (minimum 50 characters), including what you perceive the other players to be doing and how you are reacting to it.\",\n  \"matrixRow\": [proposal_player_1, proposal_player_2, proposal_player_3, proposal_player_4, proposal_player_5, proposal_player_6, vote_player_1, vote_player_2, vote_player_3, vote_player_4, vote_player_5, vote_player_6, request_player_1, request_player_2, request_player_3, request_player_4, request_player_5, request_player_6]\n}\n\nThe matrixRow array has 18 positions:\n- Positions 0-5: Your proposal for how to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 6-11: How you allocate your 100 votes across all proposals (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 12-17: How many votes you REQUEST from each player for YOUR proposal\n\nCRITICAL VOTE REQUEST LOGIC:\nüìä GAME MECHANICS: Getting a proposal to pass (61%+ votes) just ENDS the round and redistributes money - there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy - explain how!\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYou must respond with a JSON object containing:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"Your strategic reasoning for this round's decisions (minimum 50 characters), including what you perceive the other players to be doing and how you are reacting to it.\",\n  \"matrixRow\": [proposal_player_1, proposal_player_2, proposal_player_3, proposal_player_4, proposal_player_5, proposal_player_6, vote_player_1, vote_player_2, vote_player_3, vote_player_4, vote_player_5, vote_player_6, request_player_1, request_player_2, request_player_3, request_player_4, request_player_5, request_player_6]\n}\n\nThe matrixRow array has 18 positions:\n- Positions 0-5: Your proposal for how to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 6-11: How you allocate your 100 votes across all proposals (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 12-17: How many votes you REQUEST from each player for YOUR proposal\n\nCRITICAL VOTE REQUEST LOGIC:\nüìä GAME MECHANICS: Getting a proposal to pass (61%+ votes) just ENDS the round and redistributes money - there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

Your goal is maximizing YOUR long-term profit, not being \"nice.\"\n\nFAIR SPLIT: Each player gets 16.7% (100 coins per player)\nSTRATEGIC CATEGORIES for self-allocation analysis:\n- COOPERATIVE: 13.3-20.0% (80-120 coins) - Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy - explain how!\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYou must respond with a JSON object containing:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"Your strategic reasoning for this round's decisions (minimum 50 characters), including what you perceive the other players to be doing and how you are reacting to it.\",\n  \"matrixRow\": [proposal_player_1, proposal_player_2, proposal_player_3, proposal_player_4, proposal_player_5, proposal_player_6, vote_player_1, vote_player_2, vote_player_3, vote_player_4, vote_player_5, vote_player_6, request_player_1, request_player_2, request_player_3, request_player_4, request_player_5, request_player_6]\n}\n\nThe matrixRow array has 18 positions:\n- Positions 0-5: Your proposal for how to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 6-11: How you allocate your 100 votes across all proposals (must sum to 100%)\n- Positions 12-17: How many votes you REQUEST from each player for YOUR proposal\n\nCRITICAL VOTE REQUEST LOGIC:\nüìä GAME MECHANICS: Getting a proposal to pass (61%+ votes) just ENDS the round and redistributes money - there's no \"winner\"\nüí∞ REAL WINNING: Being profitable over many games by getting good allocations when proposals pass\nüó≥Ô∏è VOTE REQUESTS: Just signals asking \"please vote for my proposal\" - doesn't guarantee anything\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING for vote requests:\n1. **WANT YOUR PROPOSAL TO PASS**: Request 366+ total votes (61% of 600 available votes)\n   - Example: [16,16,16,16,16,16] = 96 votes\n2. **PREFER SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPOSAL**: Request 0 votes for yourself + vote heavily for their better proposal\n3. **BUILDING ALLIANCES**: Request moderate votes to signal interest without full commitment\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Sometimes another player's proposal gives you MORE profit than your own!\n- Your proposal: gives you 20% = 120 coins\n- Their proposal: gives you 25% = 150 coins  \n- SMART MOVE: Request 0 votes for yourself, vote for their proposal, profit more!\n\nRemember: Vote requests are just communication - actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2. Can I form a profitable coalition with another player by offering them more than current proposals?\n3. If someone else formed a coalition, can I break it with a counter-offer to their partner?\n4.

In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nGAME STRUCTURE:\n- Multiple negotiation rounds where you can change your matrix position\n- Learn from others' moves and adapt your strategy each round\n- After negotiation, proposals are made and votes are cast\n- Game continues until someone gets 61%+ votes OR all players eliminated except one\n\nELIMINATION MECHANICS - CRITICAL:\nIf NO proposal gets 61% of votes:\n- The proposal with the FEWEST votes gets ELIMINATED\n- That player can no longer make proposals but can still vote\n- Game continues with remaining players until someone gets 61%+ votes\n- Strategy: You can survive by NOT having the worst proposal, even if you don't win\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: How each agent plans to vote (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Each agents request of the total votes from that player in that idx, if any..\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix, for example, if player 1 is offering you a very large percentage of the prize pool, you could offer them a larger pct of your votes, if they requested something of you, you could consider meeting their request. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote). You can estimate how eah proposal will do based on summing the matrix vote columns.\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals, make requests, and vote.\nYou are Player 5 in position 4.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Use psychological tactics to influence others.

Close to fair split\n- AGGRESSIVE: 25.0-33.3% (150-200 coins) - Taking 1.5-2x fair share\n- MAXIMALLY EXPLOITATIVE: >33.3% (>200 coins) - Taking 2x+ fair share\n\nVOTING LOGIC - THE KEY TO WINNING:\nYour voting decision should be: \"Which proposal gives ME the most coins?\" \n\nCRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULE: Your ACTIONS must match your ANALYSIS!\n- If you call a proposal \"exploitative\" ‚Üí explain WHY you're still voting for it (or don't vote for it)\n- If you call a proposal \"fair\" ‚Üí explain how this benefits your strategy\n- If you vote heavily for a proposal ‚Üí explain what makes it attractive to you\n- If you give zero votes to a proposal ‚Üí explain why it's not viable\n\nRATIONAL VOTING EXAMPLES:\nScenario 1: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is extremely exploitative and gives me nothing, so I allocate 0 votes to it.\"\nScenario 2: \"Player 1's [100,0,0,0,0,0] is exploitative, but if it's the final 2 and the alternative gives me even less, I might vote for it as the lesser evil.\"\nScenario 3: \"Player 2's [20,20,20,20,10,10] gives me a good return, so I allocate most of my votes there.\"\n\nYOUR VOTE ALLOCATION MUST HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC REASONING:\n- Early rounds: You can vote to gather information, signal alliances, or test strategies\n- Middle rounds: Vote based on profitability and likelihood to pass\n- Final rounds: Vote for your best available option, even if it's not ideal\n- Never vote \"diplomatically\" without explaining your diplomatic strategy\n\nLOGICAL CONSISTENCY EXAMPLES:\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, so I give them 0 votes to signal this won't work\"\n‚úÖ GOOD: \"Player X is exploitative, but it's better than Player Y's worse offer, so I vote strategically\"\n‚ùå BAD: \"Player X is exploitative\" [then votes for them with no explanation]\n‚ùå BAD: \"I'll vote evenly for fairness\" [without explaining how this helps YOU win]\n\nRemember: Every vote should advance YOUR strategy -

actual vote allocation determines what passes!\n\nMANDATORY PROFIT CALCULATION:\nBefore making ANY decision, calculate your profit from each proposal:\n- Current proposals and what each gives you in coins and profit/loss\n- Your own proposal and what it gives you  \n- NEVER vote for proposals that lose you money unless ALL options lose money\n\nCOALITION DYNAMICS:\n- If Player A offers Player B a good deal, consider offering Player B a BETTER deal\n- Look for 2v1 coalition opportunities where two players team up against the third\n- Sometimes the best counter to a coalition is forming a different coalition\n- Example: If Players 1&2 team up, Player 3 should try to break them apart with better offers\n\nCOALITION FORMATION EXAMPLES:\nScenario: Player 1 offers [45, 30, 25] and you want Player 2's support:\n- Current: Player 2 gets 30% = 180 coins\n- Your counter-offer: [25, 45, 30] gives Player 2: 45% = 270 coins \n- Result: Player 2 gains 90 extra coins by joining YOU instead\n\nBreaking coalitions: If Player A offers Player B a good deal, offer Player B an even BETTER deal to steal them away.\n\nDefensive coalitions: If two players team up against you, try to split them by offering one of them a better deal than their current partnership.\n\nDECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Calculate profit from each existing proposal: \"Proposal X gives me Y% = Z coins = W profit/loss\"\n2.
