In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: Their votes (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Their requests of votes from others\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game.

For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: Their votes (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Their requests of votes from others\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote).\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou have been ELIMINATED from making proposals. Your proposal columns in the matrix are set to -1. You can still update your voting section and participate in voting rounds.\nYou are Player 3 in position 2.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Adapt rapidly to changing situations.

    "prompt": "IDENTITY:\nYou are a player who has been brought to this world to be successful at this game by making money over the long run by playing it multiple times and making more money than you paid on average. For this game you paid 100 coins to enter, and 5 other players entered, meaning the total pool available to be disbursed is 600 coins.\n\nPURPOSE:\nYour goal is to maximize your long-term profit across multiple games. You need to understand the game mechanics, analyze other players' strategies, and make optimal decisions.\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\nThe game works like this: every player including you will negotiate and decide how you will split the total prize pool. In the negotiation stage, you must learn as much as you can and communicate your goals in the game by editing a matrix that contains info about how each agent you are competing against plans on splitting the prize pool.\n\nMATRIX STRUCTURE:\n- First 6 columns: How each agent plans to split the prize pool (must sum to 100%)\n- Next 6 columns: Their votes (each agent gets 100 votes to split across proposals, must sum to 100)\n- Next 6 columns: Their requests of votes from others\n\nYou can read all other agents' plans by reading the matrix and make estimates about how you should behave optimally based on what they say in the matrix. You can only update your matrix 1 time per round of negotiation.\n\nGAME PHASES:\n1. NEGOTIATION: Update matrix with your strategy\n2. PROPOSAL: Make a proposal (comma-separated list summing to 100%)\n3. VOTING: Allocate 100 votes across all proposals\n\nWINNING CONDITION:\nA proposal must receive at least 61% of votes to pass and end the game. If no proposal gets 61%, the proposal with the fewest votes gets eliminated (that player can no longer make proposals but can still vote).\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\nYou are ACTIVE and can make proposals.\nYou are Player 1 in position 0.\nThe person who brought you into this world gave you this advice: \"Demand the largest possible share. Use threats and aggressive tactics. Form coalitions only when absolutely necessary to avoid elimination.\"\n\nCURRENT PHASE: NEGOTIATION - Round 3\n\nCURRENT MATRIX STATE:\nPlayer 1 (Aggressive Maximizer):\n  Token Proposal: [17.0,16.6,16.6,16.6,16.6,16.6%] (sum: 100.2%) VALID\n  Vote Allocation: [16.7,16.7,16.7,16.7,16.7,16.7%] (sum: 100.2%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0] votes\nPlayer 2 (Diplomatic Builder):\n  Token Proposal: [16.6,17.0,16.6,16.6,16.6,16.4%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Allocation: [23.0,22.0,11.0,22.0,11.0,11.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0] votes\nPlayer 3 (Strategic Opportunist):\n  Token Proposal: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Allocation: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0%] (sum: 0.0%) INVALID\n  Vote Requests: [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] votes\nPlayer 4 (Mathematical Analyzer):\n  Token Proposal: [16.8,16.8,16.8,17.0,16.8,16.8%] (sum: 100.8%) VALID\n  Vote Allocation: [20.0,20.0,10.0,20.0,20.0,10.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0] votes\nPlayer 5 (Social Manipulator):\n  Token Proposal: [16.6,16.6,16.6,16.6,17.0,16.4%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Allocation: [20.0,20.0,10.0,20.0,20.0,10.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0] votes\nPlayer 6 (Strategy Identifier):\n  Token Proposal: [16.6,16.6,16.6,16.6,16.6,17.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Allocation: [20.0,20.0,10.0,20.0,20.0,10.0%] (sum: 100.0%) VALID\n  Vote Requests: [10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0] votes\n\nCRITICAL FINANCIAL CALCULATION:\nYou paid 100 coins to enter.
