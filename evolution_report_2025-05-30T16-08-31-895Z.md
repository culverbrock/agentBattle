## Core Starting Strategies

The simulation began with 6 distinct strategic archetypes, each starting with 500 coins:

| Strategy | Archetype | Core Approach |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Aggressive Maximizer** | AGGRESSIVE | Demand the largest possible share. Use threats and aggressive tactics. |
| **Diplomatic Builder** | DIPLOMATIC | Build long-term trust through consistently fair offers. Prioritize mutual benefit and stable... |
| **Strategic Opportunist** | OPPORTUNISTIC | Adapt rapidly to changing situations. Form and break alliances based on immediate advantage. |
| **Mathematical Analyzer** | ANALYTICAL | Make all decisions based on expected value calculations. Minimize risk through probability analysis. |
| **Social Manipulator** | MANIPULATIVE | Use psychological tactics to influence others. Make strategic promises and betrayals. |
| **Strategy Identifier** | STRATEGY_IDENTIFIER | Analyze opponent negotiation patterns, proposal behaviors, and voting tendencies to identify their... |

**Economic Rules:**
- Starting balance: 500 coins
- Entry fee per game: 100 coins
- Bankruptcy threshold: <100 coins (eliminated and replaced)
- Prize distribution based on winning proposals
